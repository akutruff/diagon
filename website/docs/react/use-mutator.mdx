# useMutator

Allows you to do mutations on your state and record any changes that happen.  No mutations should be done outside the passed in mutator function.  This links up to the recorder and will trigger any components that reference the mutated data via `useSnapshot`  

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{UseMutatorExample}</CodeBlock>

Also, mutators can take any additional arguments that you like, and only the state will be closed upon.

## Return Value

Returns a callback that can be executed anywhere that will both mutate your state and trigger your react component to re-render.

## Parameters

### `state`

The state you wish to mutate.  

### `mutator`

The function you wish to use to modify your state.  This function 

### `deps : any[]` (optional)

A standard React hooks dependency list will recreate your memoized mutator.
