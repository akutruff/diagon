# App Setup

#### Demo

<Demo render={ ()=>{
  return (
    <ExampleApp>
      <Incrementor/>
    </ExampleApp>);
    }
  }/>

## Create your state

<CodeBlock language="ts">{StoreSource}</CodeBlock>

First, you need to define a `Recorder` which is the brains of Diagon. This object your main way to make changes to your state that trigger optimized re-renders in your application.

Your application state is a plain JavaScript object. Simple!

For TypeScript convenience, there is `getTypedUseRootState` to wrap the [`useRootState`](use-root-state.mdx) hook so that it will return a strongly typed version of the state for your components.

You can also use Diagon [without a React Context](#react-context-not-required)

## Create a Store

```tsx
import { StoreProvider } from 'diagon-react';
import React, { FC, useState } from 'react';
import { createRootState, recorder } from './state';

export const App: FC = () => {
    const [store] = useState(() => ({state: createRootState(), recorder}));

    return (
        <StoreProvider {...store}>
          <Incrementor/>
        </StoreProvider>
    );
};
```

At the top level of your app, you need a `StoreProvider` that will enable support for all of Diagon's hooks.  You simply pass it an object containing your state and the `Recorder` you created earlier.  

The state is optional, but since most React applications tend to have a single state store, Diagon includes the `useRootState` hook to grab the state you passed in here.  

## Create a Component 

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{IncrementorSource}</CodeBlock>

Here you see a simple counter component showing the main pattern when using Diagon with React:  

1. Get access to the state you want to use. Any state source will work!
    - You can get the root state from the `useAppState` hook you defined.  
    - Props, or any other JavaScript are perfectly fine to use.  They don't have to be in your root state and can come from anywhere!
1. Subscribe to the properties of the state that you want to observe with [`useSnap`](use-snap.mdx). When those properties change, your component will re-render.
1. Define mutators with [`useMutator`](use-mutator.mdx) to make modifications to your state.

## React Context not Required

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{WithoutReactContext}</CodeBlock>

Using the `StoreProvider` is completely optional.  For simple application, you may want your state and the hooks be accessed from elsewhere.  The hooks you use are on your `recorder` object and you may destructure them for convenience like in the examples.  You can put this destructing in a separate file to conveniently import them as well.
