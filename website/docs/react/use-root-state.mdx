import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import StoreSource from '!!raw-loader!/src/components/examples/state';

# useRootState

Accesses the topmost state that you gave to the `StoreProvider`.

It returns an untyped value, so it is a good idea to have a simple wrapper function around the hook that casts to your root type.  You can get a wrapper with `getTypedUseRootState` and passing it your state.

## Usage

<CodeBlock language="ts">{StoreSource}</CodeBlock>

## Return Value

The root state that was given to the `SubscriptionContext` via `useSubscriptionContextValue`.
