# useRootState

If you are using a `StoreProvider` and a react context as described [here](app-setup.mdx#create-a-store), `useRootState` accesses the topmost state that you gave to the `StoreProvider`. 

It returns an untyped value, so it is a good idea to have a simple wrapper function around the hook that casts to your root type.  You can get a wrapper with `getTypedUseRootState` and passing it your state.

## Usage

<CodeBlock language="ts">{MinimalFullExample}</CodeBlock>
