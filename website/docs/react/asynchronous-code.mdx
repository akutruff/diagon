# Asynchronous Code

## Using `mutate()`

#### Demo
<Demo render={ ()=>{
  return (    
      <AsyncWithRecorder/>
    );}
  }/>


<CodeBlock language="tsx">{AsyncWithRecorderSource}</CodeBlock>

The code first uses [`useMutator`](use-mutator.mdx) around the `state` in order to capure the state and allow for mutuations at the **beginning** of the fetch mutator.  This is important and the only gotcha when dealing with async functions.  Whenever your code returns from an await, or in a callback, the recorder is no longer keeping track of changes at that moment.  In order to mutate state, and therefore update components, you call the `mutate` function on the recorder with your state.  The function you pass in may now mutate the state as you wish.  This is a very useful pattern, as it allows you to do multiple asynchronous operations between as many calls to `mutate` as you like.  It also enables scenarios like batching.

One thing to keep in mind with asynchronous code, is that you'll notice in the demo that if you continually click the button, multiple promises will be executed and will each update the current time when they return. If this is undesirable, and you only wish to use the result of the latest user click, you can simply keep an identifier for each call to fetch and only update the state if the result corresponds to the latest id.  Conversely, you may also prevent additional fetches until the first asynchronous call completes.
