# JavaScript Object Change Recording
## Change Recording with Patches

At the core of Diagon, is a system that let's you execute your code, and see what changed.  Rather than other libraries that have to deeply compare your entire state tree after the fact, Diagon keeps track of what's changed as you go and returns a list of object patches that you can analyze, save, and use for undo/redo for time travel!


```typescript
import recordPatches from 'diagon'

const state = { counter: 0, otherCounter: 0 };
const patches = recordPatches(state, state => state.counter += 1);
// patches equals: [{"counter" => 0}]
```

Runs the increment function and records any object mutation into a list of `Map<>` objects containing the **original value** of each property.  

These patches allows you to rewind and undo changes by calling `applyPatchTo()`.

## Deep Object Hierarchies
```typescript

const bob = { favoriteFood: 'tacos' };
const alice = { favoriteFood: 'cake',  homie: bob };
const fred = { favoriteFood: 'pizza', homie: bob };

const state = { bob, alice, fred };

const patches = recordPatches(state, {alice, fred} => {
    alice.homie = fred;
    alice.homie.favoriteFood = 'nachos'; // Will now modify fred as you would expect.
    });

// patches equals: [{"homie" => bob}, {"favoriteFood" => 'pizza'}]
getPatchSource(patches[0]) // will equal alice
getPatchSource(patches[1]) // will equal fred

```

Runs the increment function and records any object mutation into a list of `Patch` objects that stores which properties have changed and the **original value** of each property.

`getPatchSource` returns the object that was the source of a patch.

## Undo / Redo:

```typescript
const state = { counter: 0 };
const [ backwardsPatch ] = recordPatches(state, state => state.counter += 1);
//backwardsPatch equals  [{"counter" => 0}]
//state equals: {counter: 1}

const forwardPatch = createReversePatchFrom(backwardsPatch, state);
//forwardPatch equals  [{"counter" => 1}]

//undo
applyPatchTo(backwardsPatch, state);
//state equals {counter: 0}

//redo
applyPatchTo(forwardPatch, state);
//state equals {counter: 1}

```
Increments the state counter and gets the `backwardsPatch`.  `createReversePatchFrom` produces a new patch that would undo that patch on the object passed to it.
