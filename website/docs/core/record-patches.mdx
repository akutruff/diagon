## Change Recording with Patches

```typescript
import recordPatches from 'diagon'

const state = { counter: 0, otherCounter: 0 };
const patches = recordPatches(state, state => state.counter += 1);
// patches equals: [{"counter" => 0}]
```

Runs the increment function and records any object mutation into a list of `Map<>` objects containing the **original value** of each property.  

These patches allows you to rewind and undo changes by calling `applyPatchTo()`.

## Deep Object Hierarchies
```typescript

const bob = { favoriteFood: 'tacos' };
const alice = { favoriteFood: 'cake',  homie: bob };
const fred = { favoriteFood: 'pizza', homie: bob };

const state = { bob, alice, fred };

const patches = recordPatches(state, {alice, fred} => {
    alice.homie = fred;
    alice.homie.favoriteFood = 'nachos'; // Will now modify fred as you would expect.
    });

// patches equals: [{"homie" => bob}, {"favoriteFood" => 'pizza'}]
getPatchSource(patches[0]) // will equal alice
getPatchSource(patches[1]) // will equal fred

```

Runs the increment function and records any object mutation into a list of `Patch` objects that stores which properties have changed and the **original value** of each property.

`getPatchSource` returns the object that was the source of a patch.

## Undo / Redo:

```typescript
const state = { counter: 0 };
const [ backwardsPatch ] = recordPatches(state, state => state.counter += 1);
//backwardsPatch equals  [{"counter" => 0}]
//state equals: {counter: 1}

const forwardPatch = createReversePatchFrom(backwardsPatch, state);
//forwardPatch equals  [{"counter" => 1}]

//undo
applyPatchTo(backwardsPatch, state);
//state equals {counter: 0}

//redo
applyPatchTo(forwardPatch, state);
//state equals {counter: 1}

```
Increments the state counter and gets the `backwardsPatch`.  `createReversePatchFrom` produces a new patch that would undo that patch on the object passed to it.
