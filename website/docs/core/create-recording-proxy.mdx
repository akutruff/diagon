# createRecordingProxy

See the main discussion of [The Recording Proxy](/the-recording-proxy.mdx)

Wraps an object in a proxy that does two things: 
- Keeps track of property assignments 
- Wraps child objects in proxies when they are accessed.

## Usage
```typescript
import createRecordingProxy from 'diagon'

const state = createRecordingProxy({
         counter: 0,
         greeting: 'hi'
    });
```
## Parameters

### `target : T`

The object you want to setup for change recording.  This can be a plain JavaScript object, `Array`, `Map`, or `Set`.  Objects with functions on them are not supported at this time.

## Return Value

A proxy object wrapping `target` that is setup for change recording.
