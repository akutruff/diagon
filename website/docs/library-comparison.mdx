\*[Benchmark results here.](https://github.com/akutruff/diagon/blob/master/apps/benchmark-cli/latest-benchmark-results.txt) Diagon performs consistenly 2x-8x faster than Immer even without Immer patch support enabled.  Note, of course, that any benchmarks should simply be treated as a data point and will never be a substitue for real-world profiling. Suggestions and improvements to them are very welcome.  A React benchmark on [js-framework-bench](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) pull request is [pending](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/pull/1088).
