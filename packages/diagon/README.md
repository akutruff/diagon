# *Diagon*

State-management designed to minimize renders while staying out of your way and letting you write natural mutable code without sacrificing object references. 

```bash
npm install diagon diagon-react # core and react bindings
```

Full React sandbox [here](https://stackblitz.com/github/akutruff/diagon/tree/master/apps/demo?file=src/Incrementor.tsx) and sample app [here](https://akutruff.github.io/diagon)

### `diagon`

âœ… Object change recording  
âœ… Property change subscriptions  
âœ… Mutable coding style  
âœ… Object graphs with shared references  
âœ… Cyclic references  
âœ… Map, Set, and Array  
âœ… Time travel with undo/redo built-in  
âœ… Transparent to 3rd party libraries        

### `diagon-react`

âœ… Re-renders components only if state changes  
âœ… Prevents parent re-renders  
âœ… Async mutation with rendering control  
âœ… Allows almost all your components to be wrapped in `React.Memo`  
âœ… React 18 support with useSyncExternalStore  
âœ… Render batching  
â¬› Concurrent Mode (may work but needs testing)

\*[Benchmark results here.](https://github.com/akutruff/diagon/blob/master/apps/benchmark-cli/latest-benchmark-results.txt) Diagon performs consistenly 2x-8x faster than Immer even without Immer patch support enabled.  Note, of course, that any benchmarks should simply be treated as a data point and will never be a substitue for real-world profiling. Suggestions and improvements to them are very welcome.  A React benchmark on [js-framework-bench](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) pull request is [pending](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/pull/1088).
